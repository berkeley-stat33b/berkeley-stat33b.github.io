## Overview

This is a GitHub Pages template based on Just the Class, developed for the purpose of quickly deploying course overview websites. Such websites link to previous course offerings, provide a summary of what the course is about, and may list learning goals and prerequisites. This paragraph would normally be replaced by an overview of a specific course, and could include information from the [Berkeley Academic Guide](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/).

When instantiating this template, change:

  - `README.md`
    - the `title` and `name` fields in the frontmatter
    - the "Short Title of Class" heading to be the course name followed by its title in the Academic Guide, e.g. "Stat 555: Adventures in Class Websites"
    - add an initial entry in the Offerings section
    - the Overview section and Prequisites, based on content in the [Academic Guide](https://guide.berkeley.edu/courses/stat/)

  - `_config.yml`
    - Set `baseurl` to be the empty string, ''.
    - Set `url` to be the institutional address, e.g. https://stat555.stat.berkeley.edu
